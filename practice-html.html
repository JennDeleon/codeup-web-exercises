<div class="myStory">
    When I was 9 years old I was stung by what I thought was a bee, while moving across the sate to help my friend move. Most
    would think nothing of the experience, and so did I. As a child, you think you are invincible to the dangers
    of the world. But this one experience made me drop back into reality faster than I ever wished possible. The "bee" sting
    Turned out to be a brown recluse that sent me spiraling into a world of medical trauma and fighting for my life before it
    Had even truly started. I had gotten bit on my leg, at the time, it was no more swollen than a particularly feisty mosquito.
    I didn't even think about it. Continued to help my friend move, and went on with my day like nothing had happened. Until 3am
    When I woke up with a wicked headache and fever. I of course did not relate this to my bug bite. And summed it up to just a random
    Cold, it was easy to bring it down with Tylenol. But by 12pm the same day, the Tylenol couldn't even keep it down. And my leg started
    To go numb. At this point my mom and dad brought me to the hospital. They knew something was not right, but didn't know exactly how
    Dire the circumstances were. The bug bite that had been hidden by my pants throughout the night, was not completely black
    And seemed to be spreading both down and up my leg. The pain became excruciating, to the point of passing out from the sheer
    Inability for my small body to handle such intense pain. Over the next 3 weeks, the doctors and I both fought for my life, and my
    chance of keeping my leg. I eventually recovered, and although I do have lasting damage to my leg, the true damage from that experience
    Is the painful reminder that life is too short to be taken for granted.

    Lupus has completely ruined my life. I would not wish this disease on my worst enemies.

<div class="myStory">
    Fever, joint pain, headache, stiff neck, and fatigue. These are the symptoms that I presented with in May of 2019. I was told at first that it was
    Simply a bad migraine. I knew this wasn't true. Something was very wrong with me. Fever going up each day, veering closer and closer to the point of
    Brain damage. 99.8, 100.7, 101.4, 103.7, 104.9, 106.2, 107.2. This was how quickly this disease took me. Every ounce of my being was in constant pain.
    I could no longer walk, a stiff neck turned into immobile neck. Headaches so bad I would pass out from pain. The hospital said it was just an unknown
    Virus. Nothing to be worried about, just needed time to heal they said. Two days late I woke up completely yellow head to toe. Jaundice had set in, and
    My organs began to fail. What could possibly cause such an incredibly fast decline of a healthy 19 year old girl. A stinking tick. One stupid, little,
    Blood sucking, arachnid had bitten me at some point, and injected the borrelia burgdorferi bacteria into my circulatory system. This little amount of
    bacteria, got to my brain, and caused lyme enduced meningitis. This was the start of the most difficult year of my life, where I had to fight for my
    life. This is how lymes disease almost killed me.
